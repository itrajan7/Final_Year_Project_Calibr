# 🤔🤔Abstract 
Nowadays, the main difficulty that is faced by the manufacturing industries is of segregation of tons of items and elimination of faulty items after the production. Continuous manual sorting creates issues in consistency and is inefficient in the market where efficiency is generally regarded as the key to success. The Project entitled “Calibre - A Color based Sorting Mechanism” is a prototype which is planned as a sensor and micro controller integrated hardware device that aims to segregate and sort items such as Fruits, Soaps, Marbles, Balls, etc. at industrial or smaller scale. 

The main objective of this project is to develop a hardware system which eases the manual and error-prone task of segregating items in manufacturing industry, food processing industries, malls, vegetable vendors, etc. Thus, Calibre comes with the concept in which the user just have to put the lot of items i.e. unsegregated products onto a Conveyor Belt and the system automatically rules out the faulty items, if there is any based on the required size, before detecting the color of each item and segregating them into the respective color containers; ultimately displaying the count of items under each category(Number of Items segregated, Number of Defective Items, and Number of items in each Container) on a computer device connected to the system. It makes use a DC Motor sync with a Conveyor Belt to take the items from initial stage to the segregating unit, Color Sensors, IR Sensors to detect sizes of items. Notably, the Micro-controller which is used is Arduino UNO which makes this model simple to utilize more effective. 

The mentioned prototype system is a demo rendition which maximizes the user productivity by providing a mechanism that can assist in automating the workload of segregating items, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. It provides the user with cost effective, less time in segregation and elimination of items, and technically the easiest way for differentiating objects/items.
